# v4-template

### **A template for writing Uniswap v4 Hooks 🦄**

[`Use this Template`](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template/generate)

1. The example hook [Counter.sol](src/Counter.sol) demonstrates the `beforeSwap()` and `afterSwap()` hooks
2. The test template [Counter.t.sol](test/Counter.t.sol) preconfigures the v4 pool manager, test tokens, and test liquidity.

<summary>Updating to v4-template:latest</summary>

This template is actively maintained -- you can update the v4 dependencies, scripts, and helpers:

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template
git fetch template
git merge template/main <BRANCH> --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Check Forge Installation

_Ensure that you have correctly installed Foundry (Forge) and that it's up to date. You can update Foundry by running:_

```
foundryup
```

## Set up

_requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)_

```
forge install
forge test
```

### Local Development (Anvil)

Other than writing unit tests (recommended!), you can only deploy & test hooks on [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/)

```bash
# start anvil, a local EVM chain
anvil

# in a new terminal
forge script script/Anvil.s.sol \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
    --broadcast
```

See [script/](script/) for hook deployment, pool creation, liquidity provision, and swapping.

<summary><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></summary>

### _Permission Denied_

When installing dependencies with `forge install`, Github may throw a `Permission Denied` error

Typically caused by missing Github SSH keys, and can be resolved by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

Or [adding the keys to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), if you have already uploaded SSH keys

### Hook deployment failures

Hook deployment failures are caused by incorrect flags or incorrect salt mining

1. Verify the flags are in agreement:
   - `getHookCalls()` returns the correct flags
   - `flags` provided to `HookMiner.find(...)`
2. Verify salt mining is correct:
   - In **forge test**: the _deployer_ for: `new Hook{salt: salt}(...)` and `HookMiner.find(deployer, ...)` are the same. This will be `address(this)`. If using `vm.prank`, the deployer will be the pranking address
   - In **forge script**: the deployer must be the CREATE2 Proxy: `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`
     - If anvil does not have the CREATE2 deployer, your foundry may be out of date. You can update it with `foundryup`

## notes

- dynamic fee hook

```solidity
poolKey = PoolKey(
    currency0,
    currency1,
    LPFeeLibrary.DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG, // signal that the pool has a dynamic fee
    60,
    IHooks(hook)
);
manager.initialize(poolKey, startingPrice, hookData);
```

## Things to do (13th Nov 2024 2:52 PM)

- Initialize new pool with the dynamic fee hook
  - [x] Compute the sqrt price thingy for the current price.
  - [x] TEst teh create new pool hook
- [x] Write test
- [ ] generalize the unipump contract by using Map<PoolKey, DataForPool>
- Add events and other info.
- Deploy the contract on testnet.

```bash

# solidity test script
forge script script/UniPump.s.sol \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
    --broadcast --via-ir -vvvvv
```

```bash
# deployment script
forge script script/DeployUniPumpCreator.s.sol\
    --rpc-url $RPC \
    --private-key $PK \
    --broadcast --via-ir -vvvvv
```
